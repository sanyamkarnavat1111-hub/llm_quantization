# Command to install :- uv pip install vllm

### vLLM is used to:
    1. Run and serve large language models efficiently
        You can load and run models like LLaMA, Mixtral, Gemma, Mistral, Qwen, etc., with excellent performance.

    2. Deploy LLMs with an optimized inference engine
        It’s often used instead of slower frameworks like Hugging Face Transformers when serving models to many users.

    3. Provide OpenAI-compatible API endpoints

        vLLM can expose models using the same API format as OpenAI:

            vllm serve meta-llama/Llama-3-8B


## VLLM also supports quantization (This does not mean VLLM will quantize model for you,but instead the quantized models can be used with VLLms )

    ## Supports these quantization technique:

        - AWQ

        - GPTQ

        - SqueezeLLM

        - FP8 / INT8 / 4-bit weights

    # This reduces memory footprint and cost.


# This error comes "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'vllm._C' if vllm is installed in windows python virtual environment
    - If this issue comes then we should install this library inside virtual environment created in WSL or linux.
